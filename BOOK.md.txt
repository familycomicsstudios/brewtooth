A new plane is created from nothing. You own this plane, and can choose everything about it, like its name, special rules, and laws of nature. The plane starts out as an empty island, similar to Skyblock, with a portal to the Material Plane or any other of your choice. Material from other planes can be moved to the new plane.
{{note
##### Sample Plane: The Great Library
The Great Library is a Lawful Neutral plane of existence that shares the same rules as the Material Plane, with exceptions:
1. This plane is protected from damage by destruction. The plane will always remain intact.
2. The Great Library is filled with a copy (sometimes more) of every book that has ever been in any other library.
3. Any Intellegence (Knowledge) spell used in this library automatically rolls a 20.

This plane has three portals: One to the Material Plane, one to Mechanus, and one to Sigil, the City of Doors.
